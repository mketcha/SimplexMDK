@article{Brown1977,
	abstract = {Applications in operations research often employ models which contain linear functions. These linear functions may have some components (coefficients and variables) which are random. (For instance, linear functions in mathematical programming often represent models of processes which exhibit randomness in resource availability, consumption rates, and activity levels.) Even when the linearity assumptions of these models is unquestioned, the effects of the randomness in the functions is of concern. Methods to accommodate, or at least estimate for a linear function the implications of randomness in its components typically make several simplifying assumptions. Unfortunately, when components are known to be random in a general, multivariate dependent fashion, concise specification of the randomness exhibited by the linear function is, at best, extremely complicated, usually requiring severe, unrealistic restrictions on the density functions of the random components. Frequent stipulations include assertion of normality, or of independence-yet, observed data, accepted collateral theory and common sense may dictate that a symmetric distribution with infinite domain limits is inappropriate, or that a dependent structure is definitely present. (For example, random resource levels may be highly correlated due to economic conditions, and nonnegative for physical reasons.) Often, an investigation is performed by discretizing the random components at point quantile levels, or by replacing the random components by their means-methods which give a deterministic "equivalent" model with constant terms, but possibly very misleading results. Outright simulation can be used, but requires considerable time investment for setup and debugging (especially for generation of dependent sequences of pseudorandom variates) and gives results with high parametric specificity and computation cost. This paper shows how to use elementary methods w estimate the mean and variance of a linear... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Oliveira2009,
	abstract = {Consider any random graph model where potential edges appear independently, with possibly different probabilities, and assume that the minimum expected degree is omega(ln n). We prove that the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian of that random graph are concentrated around the corresponding matrices of the weighted graph whose edge weights are the probabilities in the random model. While this may seem surprising, we will see that this matrix concentration phenomenon is a generalization of known results about the Er$\backslash$"\{o\}s-R$\backslash$'\{e\}nyi model. In particular, we will argue that matrix concentration is implicit the theory of quasi-random graph properties.   We present two main applications of the main result. In bond percolation over a graph G, we show that the Laplacian of the random subgraph is typically very close to the Laplacian of G. As a corollary, we improve upon a bound for the spectral gap due to Chung and Horn that was derived via much more complicated methods.   In inhomogeneous random graphs, there are points X\_1,...,X\_n uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1] and each pair is connected with probability p kappa(X\_i,X\_j). We show that if $\backslash$ln n/n<< p<< 1 and kappa is bounded, then the adjacency matrix of the random graph is close to an integral operator defined in terms of kappa.   Our main proof tool is a new concentration inequality for matrix martingales that generalizes Freedman's inequality for the standard scalar setting.},
